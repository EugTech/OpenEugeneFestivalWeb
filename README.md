# OpenEugeneFestivalWeb

This is an attempt at utilizing Gatsby, a React.js static site generator. 
This site will be following the layout of [mozillafestival.org]
and design styles from the [Gatsby Get up and Running Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial)

To get started, clone and...
  ```sh
  npm install
  gatsby develop
  ```

The `gatsby build` will make a deployable static site in the public folder. To use with github-pages, we either need a gh-pages branch, or we can put this in the docs folder on the master branch.
